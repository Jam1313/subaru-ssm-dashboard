"""
Builds the offline base of generic OBD-II trouble codes (SAE J2012) with Russian descriptions:

  app/src/main/assets/obd_dtc_ru.json   {"source": "...", "codes": {"P0100": ["<English>", "<Russian>"], ...}}

The DTC screen looks a code up here when the Subaru base (ssm_dtc.json) has none: P0xxx, the generic part of P2xxx,
P34xx (cylinder deactivation), U0xxx (network) and a few C0xxx. Manufacturer codes (P1xxx, most of P3xxx, B1/C1/U1…)
are not here on purpose: their meaning differs from make to make.

Sources and licenses:
  - fabiovila/OBDIICodes, codes.json (MIT), pinned to FABIO_COMMIT: the English descriptions of P0/P2/P3.
    The list has typos and some descriptions lost their first word(s) when it was made; FIXES below corrects them
    after the wording of SAE J2012 (what the code means is not changed, only the text is completed). What could not
    be completed with confidence is dropped (DROP).
  - mytrile/obd-trouble-codes, obd-trouble-codes.csv (MIT), pinned to MYTRILE_COMMIT: an older P0 list, used only
    to cross-check P0 codes and their wording (a code missing in codes.json is taken from it).
  - U0xxx and C0xxx: hand-made list (U_CODES, C_CODES) of the well-known assignments of SAE J2012 only.
  - Russian: written here, rule-based (component and fault glossaries plus bank/sensor/cylinder qualifiers) with
    MANUAL entries for the irregular descriptions, in the terminology of the app's Subaru base (ssm_dtc.json). For a
    few codes the Subaru base's own Russian is reused where the meaning is the same (SSM_REUSE).

Downloads go to a separate cache dir (--dl) and are treated as data only. Run with `python3 -I`:
